4. Selection Rules (Decision Logic)
•	If user knows exact product name → Use Method 2 (Direct Search)
•	If user is exploring options or comparing products → Use Method 1 (Category Browsing) or Method 3 (Filter-Based)
•	If product has multiple variants (size, color) → Selection rules must be completed before "Add to Cart" activates
•	If product is out of stock → Display error message and disable "Add to Cart" button
•	If user wants multiple quantities → Modify quantity field before clicking "Add to Cart"
•	If user is on mobile device → Methods adapt to touch gestures (tap instead of click, swipe to scroll)
•	If user prefers keyboard navigation → Use Tab key to move between elements and Enter to select
5. Usability Notes
•	Visual Clarity: Prominent "Add to Cart" button with contrasting color improves findability
•	Feedback: Immediate visual confirmation (cart badge update, success message, mini cart preview) reduces user uncertainty
