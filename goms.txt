Scenario 1: Goal – Close the Window
1. Goal
•	Primary Goal: Ensure the specific application or browser window is fully closed (not just minimized or hidden).
2. Operators (Atomic Actions)
•	Physically move hand to mouse.
•	Visually scan screen to locate the active window and its close button (usually a red “X” in the top-right/corner).
•	Move mouse pointer to target (close button).
•	Press mouse button (usually left click).
•	Wait for system to remove window from the display.
•	(Alternative) Press keyboard shortcut (Alt+F4 on Windows, Command+W on Mac).
3. Methods (Procedural Steps)
Method 1: Using Mouse
•	Move right hand to mouse.
•	Visually locate the correct window (if multiple).
•	Scan (top-right/top-left) for the 'X' or close button.
•	Move mouse pointer onto the close button.
•	Press and release left mouse button.
•	Confirm window has closed (visually).
Method 2: Using Keyboard
•	Place hands on keyboard.
•	For Windows: Hold “Alt” key, tap “F4”.
•	For Mac: Hold “Command” and tap "W".
•	Look for visual confirmation that the window has closed.
4. Selection Rules (Decision Logic)
•	If user is already using the mouse, use Method 1.
•	If user prefers or both hands are on the keyboard, use Method 2.
•	If multiple windows are open, ensure the correct window is active/focused before executing the close operation.
5. Usability Notes
•	Visibility of the close button and intuitive placement enhance efficiency.
•	Keyboard shortcuts boost expert performance and accessibility.
•	Error prevention: Confirm if unsaved work would be lost before closing.
